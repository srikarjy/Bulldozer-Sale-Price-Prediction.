# Bulldozer-Sale-Price-Prediction.

In this notebook, we're going to go through a machine learning project with the goal of predicting the sale price of Bulldozers.

## Problem Definition

> How well can we predict the future sale price of a bulldozer, given its characteristics and previous examples of how much similar bulldozers have been sold for?

## Data

The data is downloaded from the Kaggle Bluebook for Bulldozers competition: https://www.kaggle.com/c/bluebook-for-bulldozers/data

There are 3 main datasets:

* Train.csv is the training set, which contains data through the end of 2011.
* Valid.csv is the validation set, which contains data from January 1, 2012 - April 30, 2012 You make predictions on this set throughout the majority of the competition. Your score on this set is used to create the public leaderboard.
* Test.csv is the test set, which won't be released until the last week of the competition. It contains data from May 1, 2012 - November 2012. Your score on the test set determines your final rank for the competition.

## Evaluation

The evaluation metric for this competition is the RMSLE (root mean squared log error) between the actual and predicted auction prices.
